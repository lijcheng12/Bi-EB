#### Bicluster for (a) breast cancer luminal subtype (b) breast cancer basal-like subtype. Red color shows higher probability and green shows lower probability of belonging to bicluster. 
#### Clinical evidence: these important drug targets in breast cancer, ESR1, PGR, HER2, EGFR and AR have a high similarity in mRNA and protein variation in both tumors and cell lines [1][2]. GATA3 and RP56KB1 are two promising drug targets for breast cancer [1][2].

## Introduction
The novelty Bi-EB algorithm can search the coherent and flexible co-regulation patterns across multi-omics data both in tumors and cancer cells. Transparent probabilistic interpretation and ratio strategy for omics data is first time proposed to detect the co-regulation patterns of drug targets and identify their associated molecular functions. 


## API Link

## Features
-Muliple omics data integration <p>
-Doing biclusters among multiple omics data and specises.<p>
-Easy to use. We provide an example how to use Bi-EB, including example data and code.<p>
-systematic patterns of the (gene expression/Protein amount) ratio is found
