## Introduction
The novelty Bi-EB algorithm can search the coherent and flexible co-regulation patterns across multi-omics data both in tumors and cancer cells. Transparent probabilistic interpretation and ratio strategy for omics data is first time proposed to detect the co-regulation patterns of drug targets and identify their associated molecular functions. 

## Features
-Muliple omics data integration
-Doing biclusters among multiple omics data and specises.
-Easy to use. We provide an example how to use Bi-EB, including example data and code.
