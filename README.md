## What is Bi-EB
The novelty Bi-EB algorithm can search the coherent and flexible co-regulation patterns across multi-omics data both in tumors and cancer cells. Transparent probabilistic interpretation and ratio strategy for omics data is first time proposed to detect the co-regulation patterns of drug targets and identify their associated molecular functions.
